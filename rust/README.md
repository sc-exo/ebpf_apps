## eBPF Rust libraries

| Library                                          | Summary                                                      | Starts |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| [libbpf-rs](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-rs) | Idiomatic rust wrapper around [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf). libbpf-rs, together with libbpf-cargo (libbpf cargo plugin) allows to write 'compile once run everywhere' (CO-RE) eBPF programs. | 0.3k   |
| [redbpf](https://github.com/redsift/redbpf)      | A Rust eBPF toolchain that contains a collection of Rust libraries to work with eBPF programs. | 1k     |
| [Aya](https://github.com/aya-rs/aya)             | An eBPF library built with a focus on operability and developer experience. It allows for both eBPF programs and their userspace programs to be written in Rust. | 0.7k   |
| [rust-bcc](https://github.com/rust-bpf/rust-bcc) | Idiomatic Rust bindings for the BPF compiler collection. The goal is to mimic the Python BCC bindings in https://github.com/iovisor/bcc in a Rusty way. | 0.3k   |
